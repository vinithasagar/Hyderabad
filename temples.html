                      <h2 >JAGANNATH TEMPLE</h2>
                      <p >The Jagannath Temple in Hyderabad, India,Telangana,
                       is a modern temple built by the Odia community of the city of Hyderabad
                        dedicated to the Hindu God Jagannath. The temple located near Banjara hills Road no.12 
                         in Hyderabad is famous for its annual Rathyatra festival attended by thousands of devotees.
                         Jagannath means Lord of the Universe.
                         It is said that this is a replica of original Jagannath Temple of Puri (Odisha)
                          in context of design. The most attracting portion of this temple is its "Shikhara"
                           measuring around 70 feet in height. The red color of the temple is due to the usage of sandstone 
                           (around 600 tonnes were brought from Odisha which is being used to build this whole architecture)
                            and around 60 stone carvers got the blessing to carve this temple.
                             </p>
